Retracted Ladder
The ladder to the connection tube is retracted. The emergency protocols must have locked the station down, thinking it was an attack.
Entrance to Connection Tube

jump tube door:"One, two, three!" You shout and through yourself up -- only to fall, slip, and land on your butt. Maybe there's a better idea.;nothing*
lower ladder:Smart move! Now you can climb up to the door and then pass through the tube to the other ring!;continue*
build ladder:Building a ladder with all the debris sounds like a good idea -- until you fall and a piece off a broken chair punctures you skull.;playerdied*
