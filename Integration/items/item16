station map
The station map on the wall screen glows various hues of blue and red, indicating what secions are operating correctly and which are damaged. The red areas, the damaged areas, far outnumber the blue. You see that the Connection Tube, which you'll need to go through to get to the other circle and the escape pods, has suffered a breach. It's intact, but it's exposded to space.
