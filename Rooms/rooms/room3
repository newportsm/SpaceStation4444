BathroomShowers
After a long day of space-stationing and other space activities, you'll be so gald the artifical gravity makes showers possible. Even better, you can go number two without having to worry about a errant poop vacuum malfunctioning and flooding the station!
Unfortunately, now there are aliens here. :(
