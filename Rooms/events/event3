Broken Ladder
The ladder to the connection tube is broken.
Connection Tube
jump for tube door;turn off gravity;build a ladder*
jump for tube door:"One, two, three!" You shout and through yourself up -- only to fall, slip, and land on your butt. Maybe there's a better idea.;nothing*
turn off gravity:Smart move! Now you can float up to the door and then float to the other ring!;continue*
build a ladder:Building a ladder with all the debris sounds like a good idea -- until you fall and a piece off a broken chair punctures you head.;playerdied*
