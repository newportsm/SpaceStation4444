Connection Tube
You've made it! Safely in the airlock on the far side of the connection tube, you now have to decide: Do you want to go into the computer room or the engine room? You won't be able to come back, since opening either door will put enough strain on the outter seals they'll break.
You're in the other circle now! Congratulations!
