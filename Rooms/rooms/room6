Equipment Room
There's been a lot of damage in here -- most of the spacesuits are torn up and worthless now. There is one left though and it should fit you. Unfortunately, it looks like the one helmet in this room is trashed.
The equipment room is a disaster now! Bet your glad no one is around to tell you to clean it.
