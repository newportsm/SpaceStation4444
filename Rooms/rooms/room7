Entrance to Connection Tube
This is the giant long tube the residents of the space station would use to go from one wheel to the other. Unfortunately, the ladder to the entry port was torn to shreds by flying debris and the artificial gravity makes it too far to jump to. Sadly, the escape pods are on the other end of the connection tube!
You need to go through the connection tube to get to the escape pods.
