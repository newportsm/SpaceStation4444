Bridge
The sound of steel creaking fills your ears as consciousness dribbles back into your head one drop at a time. Languid and stale on your tongue, the still air alternates between onyx black and searing red. Blinking, you look around as the wail of the emergency siren overcomes the ringing in your ears. Whipping your head around, you immediately see a gnarled seam running down the side of the titanium hull -- the station’s self-repair functions had clearly worked. Across the bridge, you can see the remains of the dead satellite that burst through the wall. Fumbling, you pull yourself up off the ground and flick off the alarm switch and call out, “Hello?” No one responds. 
The space station is all messed up. You need to escape.
