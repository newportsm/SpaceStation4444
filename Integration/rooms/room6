Equipment Room
There's been a lot of damage in here -- most of the spacesuits are torn up and worthless now. There is one left though and it should fit you. Unfortunately, it looks like the helmet is split in two. You probably don't have time to fix it now, do you?
The equipment room is a disaster now!
