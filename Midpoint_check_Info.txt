Mid-point check Info:

What we have is a basic command-line interface that has:
	** the ability to move from room to room and look around (using the command "go to <name of room>")
	** the ability to pick up items (using the command "grab [item name]")
	** the ability to inspect a room (using the command "look")
	** the ability to respond to events (using options displayed on-screen)
	** the ability to quit the game (using "quit")

We also have:
	** ASCII graphic examples
	** ncurses practice GUIs 

We need to:
	** handle input in a more sophisticated manner
	** implement the help menu
	** integrate the game and the GUI

How to compile and start the game:
	In the Rooms folder, enter "make testGame", then run the testGame file (you will probably need to use "./testGame"). 
	
How to play the game:
	Move around the space station from room to room and type "look" to look around a room.
	The "look" command will display all the items in the room that can be picked up and all the connected rooms that you can go to.
	(You must type "look" exactly -- any changes to case, for example, will result in the game not recognizing it.)

	You can move to another room by entering the comman "go to [room name]". 
	You'll need to type the room name and command exactly (for example, case is very important, so "Go to" won't work).
	To find what rooms are connected to your current room, use "look" first.

	To pick up an item, just enter "grab [item name]".
	Again, you'll need to use the exact name.
	Also, use look to see if items are available to be picked up.

How to clean up when done with the game:
	Enter "make cleanall" to clean up all the files and "make cleandepend" for all but the executable to be cleaned.

What to look for when playing the game:
	Please be aware that, at this point, the game does not have an ending!
	When we are done, the game will end when the player has gotten to the escape pods after powering on the generator.
	Several events are still missing, so the most you'll be able to do is go around the space station and interact with three events.
	-- There are two alien attack events. The first one you can escape using "flash with flashlight" and the second you can escape using "hit it".
	-- In the connection tube, you can get access to the next rooms using "turn off gravity".
	
	Please try some of the other options displayed by events when playing the game as well!
	-- They will either result in player death or nothing happening. It's kind of fun...

	You may want to look at the roomsconnected file in Rooms/rooms as it will help you get an idea of how the space station is laid out.
	Please be careful not to edit the file, though, as it will probably totally break the game!

Compiling nCurses files:
	Navigate to the practice folder in the nCurses directory and enter: g++ -o [executable name] [file name of cpp file] -lncurses
	For example: g++ -o colors colors.cpp -lncurses
	You can then execute the small programs with the chosen executeable name (for example, "./colors").

What to look for with nCurses files:
	These are mostly for practice as we've never used nCurses before. 
	We will taking what we've learned here and applying it to the game.
	We believe that, thanks to this practice, we'll be able to more quickly implement the necessary nCurses functions for the game.
