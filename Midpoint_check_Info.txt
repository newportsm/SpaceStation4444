Mid-point check Info:

What we have is a basic command-line interface that has:
	** the ability to move from room to room and look around (however you must type "go to <name of room>")
	** the ability to pick up items
	** the ability to respond to events
We also have:
	** ASCII graphic examples
	** ncurses practice GUIs 

We need to:
	** handle input in a more sophisticated manner
	** implement the help menu
	** integrate the game and the GUI

How to start the game:
	In the Rooms folder, enter "make testGame", then run the testGame.exe file. You may want to look at roomsconnected file in
	Rooms/rooms as you must enter the name of the room you want to move to and this file will tell you what files are connected.

How to play the game:
	Move around the space station from room to room and type "look" to look around a room. 

How to clean up after the game:
	Enter "make cleanall" to clean up all the files and "make cleandepend" for all but the executable to be cleaned.
