After a long day of space-stationing and other space activities, you'll be so gald the artifical gravity makes showers possible. Even better, you can go number two without having to worry about a errant poop vacuum malfunctioning and flooding the station!

Unfortunately, it looks the water pump is off, so you couldn't take a shower now if you wanted to.
